# About

Welcome to Creative Coding Kortrijk (CCK), a vibrant community where technology meets creativity! We're a collective of artists, designers, programmers, and enthusiasts dedicated to exploring the intersection of art and code.

## Our Mission

At CCK, we believe in the power of creative coding as a tool for expression, innovation, and collaboration. Our mission is to provide a platform where individuals can experiment with technology in imaginative ways, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. We aim to foster a culture of learning, sharing, and creating, where both beginners and seasoned professionals can thrive.

## What We Do

We host a variety of events, workshops, and meetups designed to inspire and educate. Whether you're interested in generative art, interactive installations, digital fabrication, or algorithmic music, there's something for everyone. Our events are hands-on, encouraging participants to dive in and start creating from day one. We are also hiding the first digit of the code in plain sight since it is "1".

In addition to our regular events, we collaborate with local artists, cultural institutions, and tech companies to bring innovative projects to life. We also support the development of personal projects through mentorship and peer feedback, helping our members turn their ideas into reality.

Our community is diverse and inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds and skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned coder, an artist exploring new mediums, or someone curious about the creative potential of technology, you'll find a supportive and inspiring environment at CCK. Our members come from a wide range of disciplines, united by a shared passion for creative coding.
