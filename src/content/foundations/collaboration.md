title: Collaboration and Sharing
description: A strong culture of collaboration and openness allows members to share code, resources, and techniques freely. By sharing work and providing feedback, community members help each other grow and inspire new projects. Open-source platforms and code repositories are common tools in this space.

## Workshop: Open Coding Nights

Our Open Coding Nights are informal monthly workshops where community members bring their current projects to share and develop with others. Each event kicks off with a short "show and tell" where attendees can showcase what they’ve been working on, discuss any challenges, and open the floor for feedback or collaboration.

These nights create an open environment for collaboration where participants swap code snippets, ideas, and solutions. We also have a code repository specifically for these events, where members can share and document their contributions so others can build on them. This fosters a collaborative spirit and helps create a supportive, dynamic learning environment.
