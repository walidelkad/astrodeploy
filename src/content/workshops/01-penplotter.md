Pen plotters have seen a creative resurgence in recent years, bridging technology and art through precise, computer-controlled drawings that allow for unique, intricate designs on paper. This workshop explores the potential of pen plotters as a tool for artists, designers, and creatives who want to experiment with generative art and create pieces that combine digital precision with traditional media. Participants will learn how to use vector-based software to design their own images, control the plotter's movements, and experiment with different pens, brushes, and inks to bring their ideas to life.

Through hands-on activities, attendees will delve into the fundamentals of vector graphics, explore various pen and stroke techniques, and discover ways to integrate randomness and organic forms into their designs. The workshop encourages experimentation, from selecting unconventional media to modifying the plotter’s settings for varied outputs. Whether you're looking to create intricate geometric designs, organic textures, or abstract compositions, this workshop offers the skills and inspiration to make it happen. By the end, participants will leave with a one-of-a-kind artwork and a deeper understanding of how plotters can be used as a creative, expressive tool.
