This workshop dives into the world of **Max/MSP**, a powerful visual programming language for music, sound, and multimedia, designed for artists and musicians who want to explore creative audio-visual possibilities. Max/MSP allows users to create custom interactive environments by connecting visual “objects” on the screen, making it accessible to beginners without programming experience and robust enough for seasoned sound designers. In this hands-on session, participants will learn the fundamentals of Max/MSP, exploring how to manipulate sound, create dynamic visuals, and develop interactive systems that respond to live input.

Throughout the workshop, attendees will build a series of small projects, each designed to introduce key concepts in audio processing, MIDI integration, and interactive design. From building custom synthesizers and samplers to experimenting with generative audio-visual compositions, participants will gain a solid foundation in Max/MSP’s unique “patching” workflow. By the end of the workshop, each participant will have created their own audio-visual project, equipped with the tools and knowledge to continue exploring and crafting unique digital experiences. This workshop is ideal for musicians, sound artists, and creative technologists looking to harness the power of Max/MSP for expressive, real-time media art.
