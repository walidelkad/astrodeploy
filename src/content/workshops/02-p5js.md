This workshop introduces participants to the world of creative coding using **p5.js**, a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create visually compelling, interactive graphics right in the web browser. Designed for artists, designers, and beginners with little to no programming experience, p5.js enables users to quickly bring imaginative ideas to life through code. In this session, attendees will learn the basics of programming with p5.js, from setting up a canvas to creating dynamic shapes, animations, and interactive elements that respond to user input.

Through guided exercises, participants will experiment with the building blocks of p5.js, including color, movement, and randomness, while also exploring ways to add interactivity, like mouse movements and keyboard commands. By the end of the workshop, each participant will have created a unique, animated project, with a strong foundation in p5.js that they can build on in their creative practice. This workshop is an excellent opportunity to explore how coding can be a powerful medium for expression, enabling artists to create everything from simple sketches to complex digital artworks.
